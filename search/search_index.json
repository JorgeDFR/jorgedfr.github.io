Existing datasets typically focus on outdoor scenarios and rely on a single LiDAR sensor, limiting the evaluation of SLAM algorithms in complex indoor settings. The IILABS 3D dataset was designed to address these limitations by providing a comprehensive, sensor-rich dataset for benchmarking 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms indoors. It includes data from four different 3D LiDAR sensors (Velodyne VLP-16, Ouster OS1-64, RoboSense RS-Helios-5515, and Livox Mid-360), along with an IMU and wheel odometry, all recorded using a wheeled mobile robot in the iilab. High-precision ground-truth poses were acquired using a OptiTrack Motion Capture system. The dataset also contains calibration sequences and six benchmark trajectories, enabling reproducible and rigorous SLAM evaluations. To support the use of this dataset, a complete open-source toolkit was developed, providing scripts for data handling, metric computation (ATE, RTE, RRE), and SLAM algorithm benchmarking. Additionally, a benchmark suite was implemented to evaluate nine state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms using the dataset.</p> <p>Links:</p> <ul> <li>DOI (Article): 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3643753</li> <li>DOI (Dataset): 10.25747/VHNJ-WM80</li> <li>Website: jorgedfr/3d_lidar_slam_benchmark_at_iilab</li> <li>GitHub (Benchmark + Docs): jorgedfr/3d_lidar_slam_benchmark_at_iilab</li> <li>GitHub (Toolkit): jorgedfr/iilabs3d-toolkit</li> </ul> <p>Citation (Article):</p> <p>J.D.

It covered key topics such as robotic architectures, sensors and actuators, localization and mapping, motion planning and navigation, learning methods applied to robotics, and human\u2013robot interaction. Moreover, the practical component of the course consisted of two group projects. The first project was common to all groups and aimed to introduce students to robotics software frameworks and algorithmic reasoning through the exploration of the ROS framework and the Webots simulator, used to control a reactive two-wheel mobile robot based on sensor data. The second project was proposed by each group and focused on the exploration of a specific component of an intelligent robotic system, such as mapping, localization, path planning, or path control, using either heuristic approaches or learning-based methods (e.g., reinforcement learning). In this project, students were also allowed to justify the use of alternative simulators (e.g., Webots, Gazebo, Isaac Sim) and communication mechanisms (e.g., ROS, ZMQ). In the final project, students also had the opportunity to work with real robots, using one of the following platforms: Waveshare UGV Rover, Duckiebot, or TurtleBot 3 Waffle.</p> <p>My participation in this course was mainly focused on project supervision during practical classes, supporting students in the design, implementation, and validation of their robotic systems.
