The GreenAuto agenda focused in transforming the national automotive sector of
Portugal, in the scope of the current transition to low emission vehicles.
The agenda intended to create the technical and operational conditions for

start the production of a new light commercial vehicle (LCV)  in Portugal,
namely a battery electric light commercial vehicle (BE-LCV), with the
collaboration of the agenda promotors, including industrial and
Research & Innovation (R&I) entities.
The [INESC TEC](https://inesctec.pt/en) participation was in the scope of the
Work Package (WP) 10 _Automated logistics for the automotive industry_, more
specifically, in the Product, Processes, or Services (PPS) 18 -
_3D navigation system for mobile robotic equipment_.
This PPS's partners included
