## GreenAuto: Green innovation for the Automotive Industry

_(ongoing)_

The GreenAuto agenda focused in transforming the national automotive sector of
Portugal, in the scope of the current transition to low emission vehicles.
The agenda intended to create the technical and operational conditions for
[Peugeot Citroën Automóveis Portugal,  S.A.](https://www.stellantis.com/) to
start the production of a new light commercial vehicle (LCV)  in Portugal,
namely a battery electric light commercial vehicle (BE-LCV), with the
collaboration of the agenda promotors, including industrial and
Research & Innovation (R&I) entities.
The [INESC TEC](https://inesctec.pt/en) participation was in the scope of the
Work Package (WP) 10 _Automated logistics for the automotive industry_, more
specifically, in the Product, Processes, or Services (PPS) 18 -
_3D navigation system for mobile robotic equipment_.
This PPS's partners included
[Flowbotic Mobile Systems, Lda](https://www.flowbotic.eu/), a company that
designs and manufactures autonomous mobile robots.

## PRODUTECH R3 (Recovery-Resilience-Reindustrialisation): Production Technologies Cluster Mobilising Agenda for Reindustrialisation

_(ongoing)_

The PRODUTECH R3 agenda aimed to reduce the external dependence on technologies
and solutions for productive systems in the Portugal's production sector, in
order to retain in the country an increasing share of the added value generated
by the production value chains.
Consequently, [AIMMAP](https://www.metalportugal.pt/) and the
[PRODUTECH Cluster](http://www.produtech.org/) launched a comprehensive set of
projects and initiatives aimed to develop the production sector and,
simultaneously, contribute to the Produgal's national industry.
Several R&D centres from [INESC TEC](https://inesctec.pt/en) participated in the
project. The
[CRIIS - Centre for Robotics in Industry and Intelligent Systems](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/criis)
participated in the Work Packages (WP) 6,
_FlexibleRoboticSolutions - Intelligent, Compact and Flexible End of Line_
_Robotic Solutions_, and 9,
_SmartIL - Intelligent interoperable robotic intralogistics and quality control_
_platform and solutions for industry_.
These WPs resulted on the demonstration of the R&D results in several
Product, Processes, or Services (PPS), including the collaboration the main
industrial partner [JPM Industry](https://jpm.pt/) responsible for the
development of the robotic intralogistics solutions.
